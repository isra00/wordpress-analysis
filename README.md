Simple social stats from your Wordpress posts
=============================================

This script shows some numbers about the social impact of your Wordpress posts:

 * Post comments
 * Facebook shares/likes
 * Google+ "+1" count

The script needs PHP and APC to work (it caches Facebook and Google+ requests
for 10 minutes), and the UI is built with HTML5 boilerplate, Bootstrap,
jQuery and jQuery Tablesorter, all of which are loaded from public CDNs.
