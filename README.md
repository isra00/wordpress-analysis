Simple social stats from your Wordpress posts
=============================================

This script shows some numbers about the social impact of your Wordpress posts:

 * Post comments
 * Facebook shares/likes
 * Google+ "+1" count

The script requires PHP 5.2 (or greater) and APC to work (it caches Facebook and
Google+ requests for 10 minutes), and the UI is built with HTML5 boilerplate, 
Bootstrap, jQuery and jQuery Tablesorter, all of which are loaded from public 
CDNs, so you just have to drop the PHP file and start using it.
