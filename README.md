## Analyze the impact of your Wordpress blog ##

This script shows some numbers about the social impact of your Wordpress posts:

 * Post comments
 * Facebook shares/likes
 * Google+ "+1" count
 * Tweets
 * Pageviews (from Google Analytics)

The script requires PHP 5.2 (or greater) and APC to work (it caches all data), and the UI is built with HTML5 boilerplate, Bootstrap, jQuery and jQuery Tablesorter, all of which are loaded from public CDNs, so you just have to drop the PHP file and start using it.

For Google Analytics, you must [authorize your account for remote logins here](https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha).

For Twitter, you need to register an app in [dev.twitter.com](dev.twitter.com) and generate an access token.
